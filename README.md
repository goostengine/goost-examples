# Goost Examples

This is a collection of examples represented as either scripts (GDScript, C#) or
as regular Godot projects which rely on the functionality implemented in the
[Goost](https://github.com/goostengine/goost) Godot Engine C++ extension.

## Importing all projects

To import all demos at once in the project manager:

- Clone this repository or [download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/goostengine/goost-examples/archive/master.zip).
  - If you've downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it somewhere.
- Open the Godot project manager and click the **Scan** button on the right.
- Choose the path to the folder containing all demos.
- All demos should now appear in the project manager.

## Compatibility

The default branch is compatible with the latest stable Godot version.

If you are using an older (or future) version of Godot, use the appropriate
branch for your Godot version:

- [`gd3`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost-examples/tree/gd3) for Godot 3.x.
- [`gd4`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost-examples/tree/gd4) for Godot 4.x.
